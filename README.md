## ⚫ Enter the Abyss
Diving into the void where logic meets precision, and optimization carves the path forward.  
Since **January 22, 2025**, I have been sharpening my problem-solving skills in **Java**,  
embracing the complexity that lies in the depths.  
Each challenge is a new fragment of the unknown, decoded through efficiency and control.  

### ⏳ Competitive Coding & Time Complexity
Competitive coding demands not only accuracy but also an understanding of **time complexity**—the measure of an algorithm’s efficiency.  
I strive to refine solutions by reducing execution time from **O(n²) to O(n log n) or better**,  
optimizing every step to handle large inputs seamlessly.


💜 *In the silent void of the unknown, mastery is forged. The journey deepens...*
